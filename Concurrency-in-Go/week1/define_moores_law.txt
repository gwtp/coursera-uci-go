Moore's law is an observation where the number of transistors on a CPU double approx every 2
years.
It stopped being true because of the power wall. As you increase transistor density, does does the
power consumption and temperature. Higher temperatures would lead to meltdowns and liquid
cooling of devices is not available and less practical for devices such as laptops, mobile phones etc.
Itâ€™s also affected by Denard scaling where you cannot continue to scale the voltage down. This
introduces a new set of problems that makes it impossible to identify voltage swing, the on/off
position of a transistor. Noise and power leakage contribute to this problem.
